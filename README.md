# Markdown TOC generate
Client side Markdown table of contents (TOC) generator, very rough-and-ready.

Drop your source markdown document into the textarea, hit **Generate** and a TOC list will be built from found Markdown headings.

Available online here: http://magnetikonline.github.io/markdowntocgenerate/.

Tested with Chrome v36, but should work with any recent browser and IE9+.
